While using both of these languages I&#39;ve benefited tremendously from open source technologies, specifically <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/GDAL/">GDAL</a> with python and <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">react</a> with <a href="http://redux.js.org/">redux</a>.</p><p>Open source projects have had and continue to have a dramatic and profound effected on my career and life. A great example is the community around <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">react</a>. It is so helpful, encouraging, and positive.</p><a name=contributing-to-open-source class=anchor href=#contributing-to-open-source><h2><span class=header-link></span>Contributing to open source</h2></a><p>My teachers at <a href="http://www.refactoru.com/">refactorU</a> were the first ones to mention contributing to open source. They said &#39;if you found a bug, fix it and make a pull request&#39;, so I did. My <a href="https://github.com/loganbestwick/geo-tools/commits?author=hartzis">first contribution</a> to open source was simple, but it felt great knowing I gave back and possibly helped someone else.</p><a name=react-community class=anchor href=#react-community><h3><span class=header-link></span>React community</h3></a><p>After contributing to a few other small libraries and getting PR&#39;s merged in I was added as a member and maintainer on a simple yet powerful react component - <a href=https://github.com/dogfessional/react-swipeable/graphs/contributors>react-swipeable</a>. I truly felt honored and took the responsibility seriously and as I contributed to react-swipeable it helped build my confidence and I started to look for opportunities to contribute to bigger projects.</p><p>I was able to <a href="https://github.com/reactjs/redux/commits?author=hartzis">contribute</a> to <a href="http://redux.js.org/">redux</a> early-ish in its evolution in an attempt to help with some examples. <a href=https://twitter.com/dan_abramov>Dan Abramov</a> is truly a stupendously nice person and he was amazingly <a href=https://github.com/reactjs/redux/pull/424>responsive and helpful</a>!</p><a name=open-source-sum-up class=anchor href=#open-source-sum-up><h2><span class=header-link></span>Open source sum up</h2></a><p>I can attest that open source contributing is fun, fulfilling, and actually not too hard to do. Many open source maintainers need almost any help they can get, and a great way to get started is just helping with documentation! I encourage all entry level devs to attempt to contribute back to their communities.</p><p>Most of my posts are fairly small and with this post I just wanted to lightly touch on my personal experience&#39;s with open source. It has been an amazing and rewarding journey that I wish to continue even though I am slightly scared of open source fatigue.</p><p>Here&#39;s to a bright, open, and knowledge filled sharing future!</p></section><footer><hr/><h4>Thanks taking the time to gander at my electronic writings, please:</h4><ul><li><a href="http://www.twitter.com/share?url=http://hartzis.me/open-source-contribution&amp;amp;text=Open Source - contribute too">share this on the twitter</a></li><li><a href="http://twitter.com/hartzis">follow me on the twitter</a></li><li><a href="http://github.com/hartzis">check out what I&#x27;ve been coding</a></li><li><a href="/posts">see my other posts</a></li></ul></footer></article></main></div></div>
