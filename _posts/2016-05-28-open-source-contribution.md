I started my developing adventures in javascript and front end development a little over two years ago, and a little before that enjoyed scripting with python. Both of these experiences have benefited tremendously from open source technologies. From [GDAL](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/GDAL/) to [react](http://facebook.github.io/react/) and [redux](http://redux.js.org/).

These open source projects have dramatically and profoundly effect my life both personally and fiscally. Specifically the community around [react](http://facebook.github.io/react/) is so strong, encouraging, and positive. I've been able to contribute to many open source projects over the past two years with great responses, encouragement, and success.

##Contributing to open source

I don't know why, but I felt extremely comfortable early on trying to contribute back to the open source community. My [first contributions](https://github.com/loganbestwick/geo-tools/commits?author=hartzis) to open source were simple, but it felt great knowing I gave back and possibly helped someone else.

After contributing to a few other small libraries and getting PR's merged in I was added as a collaborator on a cool react component - [react-swipeable](https://github.com/dogfessional/react-swipeable/graphs/contributors). I truly felt honored and took the responsibility seriously. Contributing to react-swipeable definitely helped build my confidence and I started to look for ways to contribute to bigger projects.

[Dan Abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov) is truly a stupendously nice person. I was able to [contribute](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/commits?author=hartzis) to [redux](http://redux.js.org/) early-ish in its evolution in an attempt to help Dan with some examples, and he was amazingly [responsive and helpful](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/pull/424)!

##Just to sum up

I try to keep my posts fairly small and to a point and with this post I just wanted to lightly touch on my personal experience with open source. It has been an amazing and fulfilling journey that I wish to continue. I am slightly scared of the open source fatigue and have definitely felt it a bit.

Here's to a bright knowledge sharing future!
