I started my developing adventures in javascript and front end development a little over two years ago, and a little before that enjoyed scripting with python. Both of these experiences have benefited tremendously from open source technologies. From [GDAL](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/GDAL/) to [react](http://facebook.github.io/react/) and [redux](http://redux.js.org/).

These open source projects have dramatically and profoundly effect my life both personally and fiscally. Specifically the community around [react](http://facebook.github.io/react/) is so strong, encouraging, and positive. I've been able to contribute to many open source projects over the past two years with great responses, encouragement, and success.

##Contributions to open source

I don't know why, but I felt extremely comfortable early on trying to contribute back to the open source community. My [first contributions](https://github.com/loganbestwick/geo-tools/commits?author=hartzis) to open source was to simply add some properties to a config for some tools. But it felt great contemplating that my little bit of code could help someone else.

After contributing to a few other small libraries and getting PR's merged in I was added as a collabortor on a pretty successful react component. I truly felt honored and took the responsibilty seriously. I've definitely put some hours into this component, and have felt from the community that my contributions were welcome and wanted.

[Dan Abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov) is truly a stupendously nice person. I [contributed](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/commits?author=hartzis) to [redux](http://redux.js.org/) early-ish in its evolution in an attempt to help Dan with some examples, and he was amazingly [responsive and helpful](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/pull/424)!

I've also had great open source success working with people at [AirBnb](https://github.com/airbnb). [Enzyme](/) is AirBnb's open sourced react testing library, and it is simaliar to another testing library I had contributed to called [skin-deep](/).

Since props going into a react component are just an object with keys/values, when you want to test and you use shallow rendering you can just select components based on prop values. I helped add this [feature](/) to [skin-deep](/) and I also thought this would be a great addition to [enzyme](/) so I created an [issue](/) and started a [PR](/). The team at AirBnb and other contributors were also incredibly helpful and give very constructive feedback.
