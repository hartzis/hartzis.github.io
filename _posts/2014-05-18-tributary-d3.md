I'd like to share what maybe the greatest tool for working with D3js: [tributary.io](http://www.trubutary.io).
 
> This web application lets you build any D3 visualization you can imagine right in your browser. No need to setup the D3 environment locally when you want to just test out an idea or quickly get a proof of concept going.

####My work with tributary.io:

I used [tributary.io](http://www.trubutary.io) extensively while collaboratively working on [CMPD2012](http://CMPD2012.herokuapp.com). This application was so easy to use, responsive and instantly refreshed and updated changes as you typed.

> Tributary uses your github.com authentication to save your work to your [Gist](http://gist.github.com).
