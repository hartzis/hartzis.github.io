Just to put some more information out into the world because I had some trouble with this.

I'm using the new [fetch api](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/03/introduction-to-fetch?hl=en) in google chrome and sending put/post request to an express/node application.

Short post so my future self remembers and hopefully helps others.
