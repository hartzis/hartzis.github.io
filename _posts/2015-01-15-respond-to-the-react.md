This is my third javascript framework I have begun to learn in under a year since graduating from [RefatorU](www.refactoru.com). Started the roller coaster with Angular, then traversed Backbone w/JQuery, and now the V(iew) that is [Reactjs](https://facebook.github.io/react/)!

> I say ish since React is mostly just the View of a framework, but dizzam it is powerful and fast!

####The Code - React and jsx


####Testing - React and Jest



#####Fun stuff - React and socket.io
