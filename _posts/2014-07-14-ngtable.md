I'm working on creating an interactive table that displays thousands of records that needs to be capable of both filtering by specific parameters and sortable. So here is a short and sweet chat about my adventure.

>AngularJS offers great modularity with directives, so I knew there had to be a powerful and customizable table directive out there somewhere.  

I found three:

- [ngTable](http://bazalt-cms.com/ng-table/)
- [ng-grid](http://angular-ui.github.io/ng-grid/)
- [trNgGrid](http://moonstorm.github.io/trNgGrid/beta/index.html)

#####ng-grid
I first looked at ng-grid since it was backed by the angular-ui team. It seems to have slowed down its development sadly and I also needed strong pagination and ‘items per page’. View example [plnkr](http://plnkr.co/edit/T6qaQX?p=info).

#####trNgGrid
trNgGrid didn’t quite have the backing and support I was looking for either, and its current release didn’t have the strong stable features of its next release. The creator also forgot to include a way to quickly demo and explore the directive using plnkr/jsfiddle or any of those.

#####ngTable
I decided on [ngTable](http://bazalt-cms.com/ng-table/). This directive has great pagination, customization, and strong filter/sorting capabilities. I've also been able to find a lot of answers and support for questions online. View example [plnkr](http://plnkr.co/edit/ISa4xg?p=info).

######ngTable custom filter example

~~~ javascript
getData: function($defer, params) {
  // custom filter applied
  filteredData = _.reduce(_.toArray($scope.filters.filterByFieldType), function(sum, val) {return sum + val}) > 0 ?
          $filter('filterByCheckboxColumn')(filteredData, $scope.filters.filterByFieldType, 'Field') :
          filteredData;
  // order data by selected column
  var orderedData = params.sorting() ?
          $filter('orderBy')(filteredData, params.orderBy()) :
          filteredData;

  // set total for recalc pagination
  params.total(orderedData.length);
  // return data with promise
  $defer.resolve(orderedData.slice((params.page() - 1) * params.count(), params.page() * params.count()));
}

#####Final thoughts
As always I am having a great time with how declarative AngularJS is and the fun that is directives. I highly recommend ngTable for all your data table needs. Let me know if you have any questions or need help with ngTable.
