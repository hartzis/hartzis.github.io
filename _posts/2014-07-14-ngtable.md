I'm working on creating an interactive table that displays thousands of records that needs to be capable of both filtering by specific parameters and sortable.

AngularJS offers great modularity with directives, so I knew there had to be a powerful and customizable table directive out there somewhere.  I found three:

-[ngTable](http://bazalt-cms.com/ng-table/)
-[ng-grid](http://angular-ui.github.io/ng-grid/)
-[trNgGrid](http://moonstorm.github.io/trNgGrid/beta/index.html)

I first looked at ng-grid since it was backed by the angular-ui team. It seems to have slowed down its development sadly and I also needed strong pagination and ‘items per page’.

trNgGrid didn’t quite have the backing and support I was looking for either, and its current release didn’t have the strong stable features of its next release.

I decided on [ngTable](http://bazalt-cms.com/ng-table/). This directive has great pagination, customization, and filter/sorting capabilities. It also has a great internet support team and backing.
