Recently I've been grasping at and learning more and more about functional programming. React has helped me quite a bit in this venture, but more recently [Redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux) has come into my life and I've been truly enjoying developing with it.

My adventure with redux began July 30, 2015. It was warm sunny day in Denver, CO, and one of my coworkers mentioned he'd heard of this amazing state manager that we can use with react called [Redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux). I was instantly hooked since we had recently been internally working on a state manager that resembled a lot of what redux was going for.

I quickly read everything about it that I could find online, cloned the repo and poked at examples. That same day I created [shop ducks with redux](https://github.com/hartzis/react-with-redux-shop-ducks) that I used to explore it more.
