Password validation based on specific security parameters was the task at hand. I wanted instant validation as the user typed their password in. These were the specifications that the user needed to meet.

* 8 characters in length
* one uppercase
* one lowercase
* one special character

####Example validations

As I browsed the internet using Chrome developer tools I came across a couple cool implimentations.

* [Car2go](https://www.car2go.com)'s password reset functionality
* [Stack Exchange](https://stackexchange.com/users/login#create-account)'s new user creation

I quickly copied stack exchanges solution javascript into a gist and went at creating a codepen from it! You can find the gist at the end of the post.

####Codepen

Enter the amazing code playground that is Codepen.io! I built the following codepen that anyone is free to copy/use/fork.
