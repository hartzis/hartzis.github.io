I'd like to share some of what I learned during my image uploading adventure time.

I'm currently building a couple little apps to digest, cateloge, and display my heel clicking worldly adventures.
  

While building the image processing app I needed to upload the images to an express server. This proved to be a very awesome learning experience and I felt like I needed to share what I created in order to help others and probably myself some other time down the road.
